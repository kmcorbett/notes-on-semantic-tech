Here’s a chronological listing of notable programming languages that bridge OOP, declarative, functional programming (FP), rules-based, and logic-functional paradigms, grouped by their primary paradigm and historical emergence:

Declarative / Rules-Based

	1.	Prolog (1972)
	•	Logic programming, declarative syntax.
	2.	CLIPS (1985)
	•	Rules-based expert system development.
	3.	Drools (2001)
	•	Rules engine for Java, integrating declarative logic into OOP.

Functional Programming (FP)

	1.	LISP (1958)
	•	Functional programming foundations with symbolic processing.
	2.	ML (1973)
	•	Functional programming with strong type inference.
	3.	Haskell (1990)
	•	Pure functional programming with lazy evaluation.
	4.	F# (2005)
	•	Functional-first with OOP features, runs on .NET.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

	1.	Smalltalk (1972)
	•	Early OOP with message passing and dynamic typing.
	2.	C++ (1985)
	•	OOP with low-level system programming capabilities.
	3.	Java (1995)
	•	OOP with platform independence, later extended with declarative tools like Drools.

Logic-Functional Hybrids

	1.	λProlog (1986)
	•	Combines functional programming and logic rules.
	2.	Mercury (1995)
	•	Logic-functional language emphasizing performance and modularity.

Multi-Paradigm

	1.	Common Lisp (1984)
	•	Combines functional programming with OOP extensions (via CLOS).
	2.	Oz/Mozart (1991)
	•	Multi-paradigm, supporting OOP, FP, and constraints.
	3.	Scala (2004)
	•	Combines FP and OOP, runs on the JVM.
	4.	Kotlin (2011)
	•	Multi-paradigm with declarative DSLs and OOP.
	5.	Clojure (2007)
	•	Functional Lisp for JVM with optional rules (e.g., core.logic).

Timeline Summary:

	•	1950s-70s: Declarative (LISP, Prolog), early OOP (Smalltalk).
	•	1980s: Functional expansion (ML, Common Lisp), OOP mainstream (C++), rules systems (CLIPS).
	•	1990s: Logic-functional hybrids (λProlog, Mercury), multi-paradigm (Oz).
	•	2000s: Modern multi-paradigm (Scala, F#), OOP extended with rules (Drools).
	•	2010s: Multi-paradigm for enterprise (Kotlin, Clojure).

This timeline highlights how paradigms evolved and blended to meet diverse programming needs over time.
